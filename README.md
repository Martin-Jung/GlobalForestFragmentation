# GlobalForestFragmentation
Code and data repository for the analysis of global forest fragmentation
[ Insert Publication link here ]

The maps in */Data* are produced using JAXA ALOS PALSAR FNF maps. See [http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/fnf_index.htm](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/fnf_index.htm) to get access to the original FNF maps instead of the modified products here
The code in */Code* can be adapted to reproduce the analysis or produce the same products at higher or lower target resolution (1 degree tile divided by x)

The author and maintainer of this repository has no relationship to JAXA and JAXA retains ownership of the original dataset.
